# Alpine Postgis Docker

A repository hosting my Dockerfile and initialization scripts for alpine postgres v11.4 with 
postgis configured at v2.5.2. The image is designed to be lightweight.

## Contributing

Open an issue, submit a PR. If you have issues with your setup, I will try to help diagnose, but
without a tested PR, I likely won't make many changes to the repo, except updating versions/deps.

## Use

Open a terminal and either clone this repository or run `docker pull cooksamuel/alpine-postgis`
